ASTROLOGY EXPERIMENT

Astrology is not the same as astronomy.  According to the New Oxford American Dictionary, astronomy is “the branch of science that deals with celestial objects, space, and the physical universe as a whole.” Astrology is “the study of the movements and relative positions of celestial bodies interpreted as having an influence on human affairs and the natural world.”

Answer the following questions after selecting your horoscope:

In order for astrology to be a testable science it needs to be able to make accurate predictions.  For you to trust the predictions of astrology, what percentage of students in our class should be able to choose the horoscope that corresponds to their zodiac sign? Half (50%)? Two-thirds (67%)?  90%?  100%?



If astrology is bogus and can’t be used to predict the future, how many students will get it right? Consider that some students might randomly guess their correct horoscope.



Are there enough/too many students in this class to make a good study?  Should there be more?  Less?



Why didn’t I tell you the “answers” beforehand and then ask if you thought the horoscope fit?



What does this tell you about horoscopes?  What sort of “predictions” do they make?
