A: A love partner may be away, ---, causing you to have to put your passions and desires - not to mention the need for your friend's company - on hold. Don't let this catapult you into a lousy mood. If you're artistic, throw all your energies and passions into creative work. If you're athletic, go play a game of tennis or racquetball. Time will pass more quickly that way until your partner returns. Hang in there!

B: If you're involved in a creative project, ---, your imagination might seem to have deserted you. You might rack your brain trying to think up new ideas but draw a blank every time. Perhaps this isn't the best day to work on your project. Sometimes we need a break from our work to maintain the quality of it. Do something else for today. Tomorrow you'll be back to normal.

C: A close friend or love partner may not be returning your calls, ---, and your insecurities could well get the best of you, causing you to think your friend doesn't care anymore. Don't fall into this trap. Your friend is probably surrounded by a lot of demanding people who need assistance, and therefore isn't phoning anybody else. Be patient, distract yourself, and give your friend another call tomorrow. The response should be more immediate then!

D: A close friend or love partner might be feeling a little blue, ---, and could therefore ring you up wanting a sympathetic shoulder to cry on. You'll be of great help to this person this way, but don't let your friend distract you from other things you need to do. You may have errands to run, people to see, tasks to take care of. Give your friend as much time as you feel is appropriate, then make your excuses.

E: Do you have a date tonight with someone special, ---? If so, expect some delays. You might get tied up with doing your daily errands. This could be frustrating both for you and your partner, but you'll eventually touch base. Don't get so upset over the delays that you're in a bad mood when you meet. This won't help at all! Just hang in there and you'll still have a great evening.

F: A friend may ask for your assistance with regard to finances in some way, ---. It's nothing major, but it might involve a choice that your friend needs to make. Don't try to make the decision for him or her, but do point out enough facts to enable them to realize exactly what's best for them. This way your friend will be sure he or she thought up the idea. Your wisdom will definitely be appreciated!

G: Overindulgence in food or drink could have you feeling a little under the weather today, ---. Therefore it will be difficult to focus on anything that needs your attention. Perhaps you just need to take it slowly so as to recoup your energy. Do just enough to keep your conscience clear, but don't wear yourself out. Get a good book, a cup of tea, then sit on the couch and relax.

H: Are you going out shopping today, ---? If so, expect at some point to be confronted with a wonderful luxury item you'd give your eyeteeth for but can't really justify purchasing. Don't be impulsive, but don't hold back unnecessarily either. Will you really enjoy the item? Or is it something you'd look at for a while, then put away or ignore? Do what you want, but be sure you know what that is! Think about it!

I: Intellectual or spiritual concepts that you're trying to grasp may seem a little elusive, ---. Don't try to push yourself too hard to understand them today; you'll only confuse yourself that much more. You're not losing it; your mental biorhythms are simply low. Instead, look at something else for a while, and let the information churn around in your subconscious. It may hit you tomorrow and you'll want to cry, "Eureka!" Be patient with yourself.

J: You're probably looking pretty good, ---, but emotionally you might not feel very attractive. This could be one of those days when you look in the mirror and think you're seeing Frankenstein's monster. This is a great day to pamper yourself a little. Go for a haircut and a massage, and take a sauna or Jacuzzi while you're at it. Treat yourself to a fruit smoothie at the local juice bar. You'll feel better! Enjoy!

K: Today you might be feeling a little out of sorts, ---, and most likely will want to stay home. Crashing in front of the TV seems a lot more tempting than going out socializing. Friends, however, may try to talk you into partying with them. Don't let yourself be talked into anything you don't feel like doing. Make your friends understand that you'd best relax tonight, and that you can go out with them another time.

L: Are you expecting visitors, ---? If so, you might go into a panic because your house isn't as spotless and beautiful as you would like it to be. You might be tempted to take broom, mop, and pail and whip through the place like a cyclone! Don't try to do too much. Your guests won't care if the unused back bedroom is messy or not. You'll want to have enough energy to enjoy their company. Take care!
