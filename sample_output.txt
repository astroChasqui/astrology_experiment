A: You could be feeling especially sensual and passionate today, ---, and you'll want to get together with a love interest. However, other responsibilities could get in your way. This could provide you with the perfect excuse to sink into gloom, but don't fall into this trap. Get whatever business you're facing handled and out of the way. Or perhaps you can arrange to finish it tomorrow. Then set up that hot date!

B: Today you might realize that you need to make a certain purchase, ---. Perhaps your home or car requires some important repairs, or maybe some new equipment is necessary for your work. This could prove rather disheartening, as it might involve spending money that you'd rather use for something more exciting. Think of the trouble this expenditure should save you, however, and you'll see the value of it all.

C: Today you're likely to find your routine too boring for words, ---, and may have a sudden powerful urge to cut loose and play some serious hooky. Still, you may feel the pull of obligation. This conflicted feeling should pass. If it persists beyond today, however, you might need to reevaluate certain areas of your life. There are lots of opportunities out there, and life is too short to be stuck in a situation that doesn't allow you to grow.

D: Today you might learn something about a friend that could be rather disconcerting, ---. There could be a dark side to this person that you weren't previously aware of, and this could cause you to want to withdraw for a while and reevaluate your involvement with this individual. When considering it, remember that we all have our dark sides. Could what you've discovered simply be this factor, or does this go too far beyond it for you? Think about it!

E: You may have your ups and downs today, ---. You could get at least one phone call of the "good news, bad news" variety, and this could have your moods swinging back and forth like a pendulum. Try to stay centered. Take the good news as encouragement, and as for the bad news, try to consider it objectively and figure out ways to turn it to your advantage. There's always a way. Hang in there!

F: A goal that you've been trying to reach may be temporarily stalled, ---, and you could be tempted to slip into despair, wondering if it will ever really happen. Remember that the keyword for today is "temporary." Whatever obstacles are in your way will eventually be overcome and your goal should be to continue to advance in the direction you want. In the meantime, take care of your chores. They may be boring, but they're necessary!

G: A rather disheartening phone call could come to you today, ---. This might bring news of a setback in one of your projects that is only temporary but nonetheless frustrating. You'll probably have to deal with some trivial little details you'd rather not bother with, and this could take up too much valuable time. Hang in there - you're still doing well! Don't let your frustrations get the best of you.

H: After the rush of energy over the past few days, ---, today you may feel a powerful letdown. Not every day can be filled with adventure and excitement. For now, you just need to take care of the routine matters that are a byproduct of life on Earth. However, keep in mind that there are many weekends coming up, and with the right kind of planning you can get excitement back into your life.

I: You may feel a bit of disappointment today, ---. You might tend to view whatever snags you've hit on the path to accomplishing your goals as personal failures, and if you let it, this idea could persist with you throughout the day. Try to remain objective, and don't lose sight of the big picture. You haven't even lost a battle - at worst, it's a minor conflict! Chances are that if you continue working hard you'll still win the war!

J: Outside responsibilities might temporarily interfere with your love life, ---. You may feel a strong desire to get together with a love partner early in the evening, but circumstances may necessitate your working odd hours. This can be frustrating, as you've been looking forward to this for a long time, but you could meet your friend later in the evening. Don't be afraid to ask. Most people understand when situations like this crop up.

K: Normally you tend to be a very spiritually oriented person, ---, but today you might find metaphysical concepts of all kinds rather baffling. Whether these are ideas you've embraced for a long time or new ones you've just discovered, you may find nagging little doubts creeping in, temporarily causing your faith to waver. This is a healthy development, however. A little doubt now and then can weed out concepts that don't work for you and reaffirm your belief in others.

L: The weight of too many responsibilities, perhaps involving family, a job, or group affiliation, could be very much on your mind today, ---. You may feel like Atlas, carrying the world on your shoulders! You're tired. Perhaps you need to reevaluate your commitments - your innate kindness may have caused you to make too many. Fulfill the ones you have, but think twice before making any new ones. You're important too, after all.
