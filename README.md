# The Astrology Experiment

A daily horoscope is scraped from www.horoscope.com, shuffled, and the signs removed so that you do not know which horoscope is for which sign. However, a key is provided at the end.

Make a group of people read the entire horoscope and ask them to tell you which one best matches their day **yesterday**. Then, show them the key and ask who got their horoscope "right". Go on to discuss how accurate are the predictions of astrology.

I run this experiment on the first day of my introductory astronomy classes for non-majors. So far all my results have been around 8% "accurate", a suspicious 1/12 chance ... hmmm ...

Have fun!
